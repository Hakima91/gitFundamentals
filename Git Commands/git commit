# git commit 
the command 'git commit' will take all the tracked changes (items added with [git add](./Add.md)) and package them up in what is called a commit.
commits come with commit messages that are requierd for each commit . you add a message to commit command by using the '-m' flage followed by message in quotes.
A commits message -can- be anything , but best practice dictates that you should use message to indicate the changes included in the commit.
for example , if we have an application we're working on where we just built out the ability to register new accounts , then you might have some variation of the following :
git add .
git commit-m "Added register functionality"
then when viewing the history of a git repository , you can pinpoint where the registraction functionality was added
