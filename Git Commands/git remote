# git remote
when working with git , a **remote** is any git repository that is not on the machine you're working on. the countwrpart to this is **local**,or the machine that is being developed on.
take github for example . while git is the technology that allows you to create local reposittories , GitHub is the site that will host your rmote repository. once stored remotely , you can bring that repository back down or share it with others.
**Note**: While the repositories (local and remote)are related and track the same project, they can have diffrent states if changes are not between the two.
*** Adding a remote
A remote can be added with the 'git remote add' command , followed by the name and location of the remote .
the name is a local name , meaning its your label and dose not impact the actual remote whatsover .
